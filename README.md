This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## iNotebook
iNotebook is a secure, efficient and on the cloud note-taking application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It allows users to manage their personal and professional notes with ease. iNotebook features user authentication for privacy, enabling users to create, read, update, and delete notes. Each note can be tagged, ensuring organized storage of information. The application also supports real-time updates, ensuring users always have access to their latest notes. Designed with a user-friendly interface, iNotebook offers a seamless experience across desktop and mobile platforms, making note management convenient and accessible anytime, anywhere.


### Key Features
* User Authentication: Secure login and registration to protect personal notes.
* CRUD Operations: Create, read, update, and delete notes easily.
* Real-Time Updates: Instant synchronization across devices.
* Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
* Intuitive Interface: User-friendly design for a seamless note-taking experience.
* Data Security: Ensures the confidentiality and integrity of user data.
* Cross-Platform Compatibility: Access notes from any device, anywhere.

### Technologies Used
* React: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
* Express: Web framework for Node.js to build the backend and HTTP requests.
* Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
* MongoDB Atlas: Cloud-based database service for data storage.
* Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
* JWT (JSON Web Token): For secure authentication.
* Bcrypt: For password hashing.
* Bootstrap: For styling and responsive design.
* Thunder Client: For API testing during development.
* CORS: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
* Vercel: Platform for deploying frontend and backend applications.


## Getting Started with Create React App
## Available Scripts

In the project directory and in the backend folder, you can run:
### `npm i`
To download the dependencies of frontend and backend


### `npm run both` 
in the root directory to run the application


Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
